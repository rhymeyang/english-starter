Here’s a comparison of the differences between them:</p><h3 id="_1-purpose" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-purpose"><span>1. Purpose</span></a></h3><ul><li><strong>Academic</strong>: For people applying to higher education or professional registration. It assesses readiness to study or train in an English-speaking academic environment.</li><li><strong>General Training</strong>: For those going to English-speaking countries for secondary education, work experience, or training programs. It focuses on basic survival skills in a broad social and educational context.</li></ul><h3 id="_2-structure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-structure"><span>2. Structure</span></a></h3><p>Both versions have two tasks, but the types of tasks differ:</p><h4 id="task-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#task-1"><span><strong>Task 1</strong></span></a></h4><ul><li><strong>Academic</strong>: You’ll describe, summarize, or explain information in a graph, table, chart, or diagram. The task requires an analytical and factual style to discuss trends, differences, or steps in a process.</li><li><strong>General Training</strong>: You’ll write a letter, usually informal or semi-formal, based on a given situation (e.g., apologizing, requesting information, or explaining something). This task tests everyday written communication skills.</li></ul><h4 id="task-2-essay" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#task-2-essay"><span><strong>Task 2 (Essay)</strong></span></a></h4><ul><li><strong>Both Academic and General Training</strong>: You’ll write an essay responding to a point of view, argument, or problem. This part is the same for both tests, but <strong>Academic</strong> tasks often require a more formal tone and are more geared toward analytical or opinion-based essays, while <strong>General Training</strong> topics may be more about everyday issues.</li></ul><h3 id="_3-tone-and-style" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-tone-and-style"><span>3. Tone and Style</span></a></h3><ul><li><strong>Academic</strong>: Typically more formal and impersonal. Use a professional tone with formal vocabulary and structure.</li><li><strong>General Training</strong>: Often a bit more relaxed, especially in Task 1, where an informal tone may be acceptable depending on the context. Task 2 essays can also be slightly more conversational, but formal writing is still expected.</li></ul><h3 id="_4-scoring-and-word-count" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-scoring-and-word-count"><span>4. Scoring and Word Count</span></a></h3><ul><li><strong>Word Count</strong>: Both tests require at least 150 words for Task 1 and at least 250 words for Task 2.</li><li><strong>Scoring Criteria</strong>: Both are scored on four criteria: Task Achievement/Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. However, for <strong>Academic Task 1</strong>, there’s a stronger emphasis on accurately interpreting data.</li></ul><h3 id="summary-table" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-table"><span>Summary Table</span></a></h3><table><thead><tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Academic</th><th>General Training</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Task 1</strong></td><td>Describe data (graphs, charts, etc.)</td><td>Write a letter (formal, informal, etc.)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Task 2</strong></td><td>Formal essay</td><td>Semi-formal/formal essay</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tone</strong></td><td>More formal</td><td>May be informal in Task 1, formal in Task 2</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Audience</strong></td><td>Academic/professional</td><td>General/social</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In summary, <strong>IELTS Academic</strong> is more formal and data-driven, suited to higher education or professional contexts, while <strong>IELTS General Training</strong> assesses practical, everyday writing skills.</p>',18)]))}const d=a(s,[["render",o],["__file","General.html.vue"]]),c=JSON.parse('{"path":"/IELTS/General.html","title":"IELTS Test","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":3,"title":"1.
