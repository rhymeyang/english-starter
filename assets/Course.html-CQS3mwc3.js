Our <strong>day-to-day</strong> lives are dominated by menial, repetitive chores that take up much of our time. Automating these is possible, and technological solutions allow us to focus on more meaningful activities. For example, there is now a robot that both cuts grass and vacuums carpets, and the manufacturers estimate that this will save the average person three weeks per year.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="homework-task-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#homework-task-2"><span>Homework Task</span></a></h2><p>Look at the question below.

This is due to the <strong>advancements in technology</strong>. It should be considered as a positive trend because it reduces road traffic accidents.</p><p>An automobile industry positively encouraging using developed technology like artificial intelligence in order to <strong>manufacture more efficient cars than in past</strong>. Day by day, Human beings are unveiling new horizons of science, an autonomous vehicle is the best example of it. A recent study found that majority of people are inclining towards driverless cars.</p><h2 id="sample" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sample"><span>Sample</span></a></h2><p>Artificial intelligence is being introduced to many vehicles to reduce the number of road traffic accidents. This is because thousands of people are killed on our roads every year and AI can control cars better than human beings. The software scans oncoming threats using a variety of sensors and can even anticipate collisions before they happen. For example, Google has developed a driverless car and after testing it on public roads, it has only had one accident, while driving millions of miles. The same number of miles driven by humans would have resulted in many more serious injuries and fatalities.</p><hr><p>This should be seen as a negative development because of the number of jobs that will be lost. Automation will always be more attractive to companies and consumers because it is much cheaper than human labor. Drivers account for a large proportion of the workforce in any economy and removing them will result in mass unemployment because they will be replaced by machines. For instance, Uber is developing new driverless taxis that will not require a person to operate them and it is estimated that this could lead to around 300,000 taxi and Uber drivers losing their livelihoods in the UK alone.</p><h2 id="main-body-paragraph-checklist" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#main-body-paragraph-checklist"><span>Main Body Paragraph Checklist</span></a></h2><ol><li>Does my main point match what I stated in the introduction?</li><li>Is my topic sentence clear?</li><li>Does my explanation actually explain how my main point <strong>answers the question</strong>?</li><li>Does my example make sense?</li><li>Does my example directly support my main point?</li><li>Have I used vocabulary in a way that makes my writing easier to understand?</li><li>Is my vocabulary accurate?</li><li>Is my grammar accurate?</li><li>Can I understand what I&#39;ve just produced?</li><li>Is it clear where one paragraph ends and the other begins?</li></ol><h2 id="writing-lesson-3-writing-your-conclusion-feedback" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#writing-lesson-3-writing-your-conclusion-feedback"><span>WRITING LESSON 3: Writing your Conclusion + Feedback</span></a></h2><p>Today we will look at:</p><ul><li>What is a conclusion?</li><li>Proofreading and checking +Demo</li><li>Your turn to write a full essay.</li></ul><h2 id="what-have-we-achieved-this-week" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-have-we-achieved-this-week"><span>What have we achieved this week?</span></a></h2><ol><li>How to write an effective introduction</li><li>How to write effective main body paragraphs</li><li>How to complete our essay</li></ol><h2 id="review-of-question" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#review-of-question"><span>Review of Question</span></a></h2><p>Nowadays more tasks at home and work are being performed by robots.</p><p>Why do you think this is happening?</p><p>Is it a positive or negative development?</p><p><strong>Robotics increasingly play a role both in the home and the workplace.</strong> This is occurring because of advancements in technology and it should be seen as a positive development because it reduces a person&#39;s workload.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-a-conclusion"><span>What is a conclusion?</span></a></h2><ul><li>This is where we state our opinion.</li><li>This is where we summarise our main ideas.</li><li>Read any academic paper and you&#39;ll be able to find the main points in the introduction and the conclusion.</li></ul><h2 id="but-there-is-no-opinion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#but-there-is-no-opinion"><span>But there is no opinion!?!</span></a></h2><ul><li>Every question is asking for your opinion.</li><li>What are the advantages and disadvantages?</li><li>Why is this? <ul><li>Is it a positive or negative development?</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="three-elements-of-a-conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#three-elements-of-a-conclusion"><span>Three Elements of a Conclusion.</span></a></h2><ol><li>Cohesive Device</li><li>Opinion</li><li>Summary of Main Ideas</li><li>衔接手段</li><li>观点</li><li>主要观点总结</li></ol><h2 id="cohesive-device" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cohesive-device"><span>Cohesive Device</span></a></h2><ul><li>You are only going to write one conclusion in your IELTS Writing test, so learn just one way to start your conclusion</li><li>In conclusion,</li><li>To conclude,</li></ul><h2 id="reiterate-your-opinion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reiterate-your-opinion"><span>Reiterate Your Opinion</span></a></h2><p>Do not worry about repetition.</p><ul><li>addresses all parts of the task</li><li>presents a clear position throughout the response</li><li>presents, extends and supports main ideas, but there may be a tendency to overgeneralise, and/or supporting ideas may lack focus</li></ul><h2 id="paraphrasing-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#paraphrasing-1"><span>Paraphrasing</span></a></h2><ul><li>I Do not worry about repeating your main ideas again, but this does not mean that you can copy the same words.</li><li>We take our main ideas from the introduction and we paraphrase them.</li><li>The makes it very simple to write a conclusion and ensures your position is clear throughout.</li></ul><h2 id="summary-of-main-ideas" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-of-main-ideas"><span>Summary of Main Ideas</span></a></h2><ul><li>Someone should be able to read your conclusion only and tell what your main ideas are.</li><li>Again, don&#39;t worry about repeating your main ideas, but you must paraphrase.</li><li>This will make the conclusion easy to write and ensure you summarise your main ideas.</li></ul><h2 id="demo-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#demo-2"><span>Demo</span></a></h2><p>Robotics increasingly play a role both in the home and in the workplace.
