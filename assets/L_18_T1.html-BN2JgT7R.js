know if there’s a gap in the market – you know, an item that no one’s stocking but that consumers are looking for.(Q29)(Q30)</li><li>然而，知道市场上是否有缺口是有用的——你知道，一种没有人库存但消费者正在寻找的商品。</li></ul></li><li>Chantal：Yeah, people don’t give up searching. <ul><li>是的，人们不会放弃搜索。</li><li>They also take things back to the store

fell apart in the wash!(Q29)(Q30)</li><li>想象一下，你在一家昂贵的商店工作，你发现那里出售的衣服被退回，因为它们在洗涤时坏了!</li></ul></li><li>Chantal：Yeah, it would be good to know that kind of thing.(Q29)(Q30)

my presentation today I want to tell you about how groups of elephants have been moved and settled in new <strong>reserves</strong>. 在我今天的演讲中，我想告诉你们大象群是如何被转移到新的保护区定居的。</p><p>This is known as translocation and has been carried out in Malawi in Africa in recent years. 这被称为移地放归，这一行动已经在非洲的马拉维进行多年。</p><p>The reason this is being done is because of overpopulation of elephants in some areas. 这样做的原因是一些地区的大象数量过剩。</p><p>Overpopulation is a good problem to have and <strong>not one we tend to hear about</strong> very often. 种群过剩不是坏事，也不是我们经常听说的事。</p><p>In Malawi’s Majete National Park the elephant population had been <strong>wiped out</strong> by <strong>poachers</strong>, who killed the elephants for their ivory. 在马拉维的马杰特国家公园，大象数量被偷猎者消灭，偷猎者为了获取象牙而杀死大象。</p><p>But in 2003, the park was <strong>restocked</strong> and effective law enforcement was introduced. 但在 2003 年，公园重新放养大象并引入了有效的执法措施。</p><p>Since then, not a single elephant has been poached. 从那以后，再没有人偷猎大象。</p><p>In this safe environment, the elephant population boomed. 在这种安全的环境下，大象的数量激增。</p><p>Breeding went so well that there were more elephants than the park could support. 繁殖进行得非常顺利，以至于大象的数量超出了公园的承受能力。</p><p>This led to a number of problems. 这导致了许多问题。</p><p>Firstly, there was more competition for food, which meant that some elephants were suffering from hunger. 首先，对食物的竞争更加激烈，这意味着一些大象正在挨饿。</p><p>As there was a limit to the amount of food in the national park, some elephants began looking further <strong>afield</strong>. 由于国家公园的食物数量有限，一些大象开始寻找更远的地方来觅食。</p><p>Elephants were routinely knocking down <strong>fences</strong> around the park,(Q31) which then had to be repaired at a significant cost. 大象经常撞倒公园周围的围栏，然后不得不花费大量资金进行修复。</p><p>To solve this problem, the decision was made to move dozens of elephants from Majete National Park to Nkhotakota Wildlife Park, where there were no elephants. 为了解决这个问题，人们决定将几十头大象从马杰特国家公园转移到没有大象的恩霍塔科塔野生动物园。</p><p>But, obviously, attempting to move significant numbers of elephants to a new home 300 kilometres away is quite a challenge. 但是，很明显，试图将大量大象转移到 300 公里外的新家是一个相当大的挑战。</p><p>So how did this translocation process work in practice? 那么移地放归在实践中是如何运作的呢？</p><p>Elephants were moved in groups of between eight and twenty, all belonging to one family.(Q32) 大象以 8 到 20 头为一组，都属于一个家族。</p><p>Because relationships are very important to elephants, they all had to be moved at the same time. 因为家庭关系对大象来说非常重要，所以它们必须同时被转移。</p><p>A team of vets and <strong>park rangers</strong> flew over the park in helicopters and targeted a group, which were <strong>rounded up</strong> and directed to a <strong>designated open plain</strong>.(Q33) 一队兽医和公园护林员乘坐直升机飞越公园，找寻一个象群，这些大象被围起来并带到指定的开阔平原。</p><p>The vets then used <strong>darts</strong> to <strong>immobilise</strong> the elephants – this was a tricky <strong>manoeuvre</strong>, as they not only had to select the right dose of <strong>tranquiliser</strong> for different-sized elephants but they had to dart the elephants as they were running around. 然后兽医们用飞镖把大象固定住——这是一个棘手的操作，因为他们不仅要为不同大小的大象选择合适的镇定剂剂量，而且还要在大象跑来跑去的时候用飞镖把它们固定住。</p><p>This also had to be done as quickly as possible so as to minimise the stress caused.(Q34) 同时，这一动作必须尽快完成来尽量减少对动物造成的压力。</p><p>As soon as the elephants began to <strong>flop</strong> onto the ground, the team moved in to take care of them. 只要大象一扑倒在地上，工作人员就立即靠近去照顾它们。</p><p>To avoid the risk of <strong>suffocation</strong>, the team had to make sure none of the elephants were lying on their chests because their lungs could be crushed in this position.(Q35) 为了避免窒息的危险，摄制组必须确保没有大象是平躺着的，因为这种姿势可能会压碎它们的肺。</p><p>So all the elephants had to be placed on their sides.(Q35) 所以所有的大象都必须侧卧。</p><p>One person stayed with each elephant while they waited for the vets to do checks. 在他们等待兽医检查的时候，每头大象都有一个人陪着。</p><p>It was very important to keep an eye on their breathing – if there were fewer than six breaths per minute, the elephant would need urgent medical attention.(Q36) 密切关注它们的呼吸非常重要。如果每分钟呼吸次数少于六次，大象就需要紧急医疗护理。</p><p><strong>Collars</strong> were fitted to the <strong>matriarch</strong> in each group so their movements could be tracked in their new home. 每组大象中的雌性族长都戴上了项圈，这样大象在新家里的一举一动都可以被追踪。</p><p>Measurements were taken of each elephant’s <strong>tusks</strong> – elephants with large tusks would be at greater risk from poachers – and also of their feet.(Q37) 工作人员对每头大象的象牙进行了测量。象牙大的大象更容易受到偷猎者的伤害。它们的脚也会被测量。</p><p>The elephants were then taken to a recovery area before being loaded onto trucks and transported to their new home. 这些大象随后被带到一个恢复区，然后被装上卡车运到它们的新家。</p><p>The elephants translocated to Nkhotakota settled in very well and the project has generally been accepted to have been a huge success – and not just for the elephants. 迁移到恩科塔科塔的大象安顿得很好。人们普遍认为该项目取得了巨大的成功，这不仅仅是对大象而言。</p><p>Employment prospects have improved enormously, contributing to rising living standards for the whole community.(Q38) 就业前景大大改善，有助于提高整个社会的生活水平。</p><p>Poaching is no longer an issue, as former poachers are able to find more reliable sources of income. 偷猎不再是一个问题，因为以前的偷猎者能够找到更可靠的收入来源。</p><p>In fact, many of them volunteered to give up their weapons, as they were no longer of any use to them.(Q39) 事实上，他们中的许多人自愿放弃他们的武器，因为它们对他们不再有任何用处。</p><p>More than two dozen elephants have been born at Nkhotakota since relocation. 自移地放归以来，已有二十多只大象在恩科塔科塔出生。</p><p>With an area of more than 1,800 square kilometres, there’s plenty of space for the elephant population to continue to grow. 面积超过 1800 平方公里，有足够的空间让大象数量继续增长。</p><p>Their presence is also helping to rebalance Nkhotakota’s damaged ecosystem and providing a <strong>sustainable conservation model</strong>, which could be <strong>replicated</strong> in other parks. 他们的存在也有助于让恩科塔科塔受损的生态系统回归平衡，并提供可持续的保护模式，其它公园也可以复制这模式。</p><p>All this has been <strong>a big draw for</strong> tourism, which contributes five times more than the illegal wildlife trade to GDP, and this is mainly because of the elephants.(Q40) 所有这些都对旅游业产生巨大吸引力。旅游业对 GDP 的贡献是非法野生动物贸易的五倍，而这一增加主要是因为大象。</p><p>There’s also been a dramatic rise in interest … 人们越来越有兴趣知道......</p>',43)]))}const
