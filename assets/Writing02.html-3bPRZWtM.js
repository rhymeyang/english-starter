I&#39;ll tell you what you&#39;re doing. You&#39;re coming with me to see Taylor Swift in London! I know that we don&#39;t get to see each other as much as we&#39;d like, what is not surprising with work and family, but wouldn&#39;t it be great to get away from all that for a day? The show starts at 8 pm, but we can get there early, have lunch and do some sightseeing.</p><p>(describe how you won the tickets) Now, believe it or not, I won the two tickets at work. It was our company&#39;s tenth anniversary party, and we all took part in this raffle. You can imagine how I felt when the boss read out my name as the winner of the concert tickets. I think it&#39;s the first time in my life I&#39;ve ever won anything.</p><p>(explain why you&#39;ve chosen your friend to go with you) The moment I held the tickets in my hand, I thought of you. Remember when we were at school and we listened to her all the time? We knew the lyrics to all her songs. It&#39;s going to be so great to see her live.
