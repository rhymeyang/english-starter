1. [First](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxO7juZNCA8&t=38s) Astronomers Detect a Possible Signature of Life on a Distant Planet
   1. A team of researchers is offering what it contends is the strongest indication yet of extraterrestrial life, not in our solar system but on a massive planet, known as K2-18b, that orbits a star 120 light-years from Earth.
2. The drugmaker Eli Lilly announced today that it had developed a daily pill that in clinical trials appeared to be as effective in aiding weight loss as blockbuster injectable drugs like Ozempic. Eli Lilly said it would seek approval from the F.D.A. to market the pill as a treatment for obesity later this year and for diabetes early in 2026.
3. [Third](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxO7juZNCA8&t=394s) According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, Elon Musk is constantly scanning the horizon for new potential mothers for his children, using everything from X interactions and DMs to huge cash **incentives** to **entice** would-be **incubators**, whom he requires to sign legally binding payment agreements with nondisclosure clauses. As a result, Musk has an undisclosed number of children that is likely well above the 14 already publicly known, and he's shown no obvious intention to stop sowing his seed. Musk seems to have reduced traditional family relationships to mere financial arrangements, undermining longtime conservative agreement around the importance of family.

   1. A team of researchers is offering what it contends is the strongest indication yet of extraterrestrial life, not in our solar system but on a massive planet, known as K2-18b, that orbits a star 120 light-years from Earth.

   3. 一组研究人员提出了他们认为是迄今为止最有力的外星生命迹象，这一迹象并不来自我们的太阳系，而是来自一颗名为 K2-18b 的巨型行星，它围绕距地球 120 光年远的一颗恒星运行。
2. The drugmaker Eli Lilly announced today that it had developed a daily pill that in clinical trials appeared to be as effective in aiding weight loss as blockbuster injectable drugs like Ozempic. Eli Lilly said it would seek approval from the F.D.A. to market the pill as a treatment for obesity later this year and for diabetes early in 2026.
   1. 制药商礼来公司今天宣布，它已开发出一种日用药片，在临床试验中，这种药丸在帮助减肥方面的效果似乎不亚于 Ozempic 等热门注射药物。礼来公司说，它将寻求美国食品及药物管理局的批准，在今年晚些时候把这种药片作为治疗肥胖症的药物上市，并在 2026 年初申请作为治疗糖尿病的药物上市。
3. According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, Elon Musk is constantly scanning the horizon for new potential mothers for his children, using everything from X interactions and DMs to huge cash incentives to entice would-be incubators, whom he requires to sign legally binding payment agreements with nondisclosure clauses.

Musk seems to have reduced traditional family relationships to mere financial arrangements, undermining longtime conservative agreement around the importance of family.
   1. 根据《华尔街日报》最近的一篇报道，埃隆-马斯克一直在扫视地平线为他的孩子们寻找新的潜在母亲，他利用从 X 平台互动、私信到巨额现金奖励等来吸引潜在的代孕者，他要求这些代孕者签署具有法律约束力的付款协议，并附有保密条款。因此，马斯克所拥有的孩子数量远不止已经公开的 14 个，而且他也没有停止播种的明显意图。马斯克似乎将传统的家庭关系简化为单纯的经济安排，这无疑削弱了长期以来保守派所强调的家庭价值观的重要性。
