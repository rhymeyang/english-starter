THE NEW MARRIAGE OF UNEQUALS 不平等婚姻新常态

Women are now more likely to marry a less-educated man than men are to marry a less-educated woman.

Once upon a time, it was fairly common for highly educated men in the United States to marry less-educated women. But beginning in the mid-20th century, as more women started to attend college, marriages seemed to move in a more egalitarian direction, at least in one respect:
A greater number of men and women started partnering up with their educational equals.

如今，女性嫁给学历较低男性的可能性超过了男性娶学历较低女性的可能性。

曾几何时，在美国，高学历的男性娶学历较低的女性是相当普遍的现象。但从 20 世纪中期开始，随着越来越多的女性开始上大学，婚姻似乎在某种程度上朝更加平等的方向发展：更多的男性和女性开始与拥有相似学历的人结为伴侣。

That trend, however, appears to have stalled and even reversed in recent years. Gaps in educational experience among heterosexual couples are growing again. And this time? It's women who are "marrying down.“ Researchers debate whether marriage between educational equals — homogamy — is on the decline. But one thing is clear: The phenomenon of women marrying men with less education than themselves, what academics call "hypogamy," is on the rise. In fact, women are now more likely to marry a less-educated man than men are to marry a less-educated woman.

然而，近年来这一趋势似乎停滞不前，甚至出现逆转。异性恋伴侣之间的教育差距再次扩大。这一次？是女性开始“下嫁”。研究人员对教育相当的婚姻-同类婚--是否正在下降展开了争论。但有一点是明确的：女性与教育程度低于自己的男性结婚的现象，即学者所说的“下嫁婚姻”，正在上升。事实上，女性嫁给学历较低的男性的可能性，现在已经超过了男性娶学历较低女性的可能性。

Christine Schwartz, a sociology professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, shared data with me on trends in the educational profile of heterosexual married couples from 1940 to 2020. According to her calculations, in 2020, American husbands and wives shared the same broad level of education in 44.5 percent of heterosexual marriages, down from more than 47 percent in the early 2000s. Of the educationally mixed marriages, the majority — 62 percent — were hypogamous, up from 39 percent in 1980.

威斯康星大学麦迪逊分校的社会学教授克里斯蒂娜-施瓦茨与我分享了 1940 年至 2020 年异性恋已婚夫妇受教育程度的趋势数据。根据她的计算，到 2020 年，在 44.5%的异性婚姻中，丈夫和妻子的受教育程度大致相同，低于 2000 年代初的 47%。在教育程度不同的婚姻中，大多数 — 62% — 是低配婚姻，高于 1980 年的 39%。

Crunching the numbers slightly differently, Benjamin Goldman, an economics professor at Cornell University, found that among Americans born in 1930, 2.3 percent ended up in a marriage where the woman had a four-year degree and the man did not. Among the cohort of those born in 1980, that figure was 9.6 percent. (This trend is hardly unique to the United States; hypogamy is becoming more common all over the globe.)

康奈尔大学经济学教授本杰明-戈德曼以略微不同的方式对数字进行了分析，他发现，在 1930 年出生的美国人中，有 2.3%的人的婚姻是女方拥有四年制学位而男方没有。而在 1980 年出生的人群中，这一数字为 9.6%。（这种趋势并非美国独有；在全球范围内，低婚配现象正变得越来越普遍）。
