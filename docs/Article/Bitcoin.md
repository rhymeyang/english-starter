[How Bitcoin ACTUALLY Works - Michael Saylor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YM9ELaVDwc)

**Host**:

A lot of people in my audience are not going to understand why you can't just store your money in dollars. Um, I have a whole tirade about it, but I'd love to hear from you—how do you explain to people why you can't just put your money in a bank account or under your mattress in dollars?

我的很多观众可能不明白为什么你不能只把钱存成美元。嗯，我对这个话题有很多要说的，但我更想听听你的看法——你是怎么向别人解释，为什么不能把钱放在银行账户或床垫底下、以美元形式保存的？

---

**Michael**:

The simple answer is that the supply of dollars has expanded by about 7% a year, every year, for the past 100 years. What that means is—if you want to buy something that is a **very scarce and desirable asset**—something the government can’t make more of, and manufacturers can’t make more of, and technology, capital, machinery, and robots can’t make more of—then it's scarce and desirable.

Here’s an example: an acre of beachfront property in Palm Beach, or a beachfront house in the Hamptons, or waterfront property in Miami Beach. That’s a desirable place to live. You can’t make more of it.

If you go back 100 years, you’ll see that the value of that acre was $110,000. You go forward 100 years, and it’s about $10 million. For those who are quick at math, they'll realize that works out to about a **7% increase per year** for 100 years.

That’s why people buy houses for $100 million on the beach in Palm Beach.

And my house—the one I’m in right now—was sold in 1930. I have the **deed** on my wall. It was sold for $100,000.

If you had taken that $100,000 and put it in a **vault**, kept it safe and sound for 90 years, and then took it out today—it would only pay for about 8 to 12 weeks of my property tax on this house.

Like, literally—you couldn't keep the house for eight weeks.

Go ahead.

简单的答案是，在过去的一百年里，美元的供应量每年大约增长 7%。这意味着，如果你想购买一种稀缺且有价值的资产——一种政府无法增发、制造商无法再造，技术、资本、机器、机器人都无法制造更多的东西，那它就是稀缺且有价值的。

举个例子，比如 Palm Beach 的海滨土地、Hamptons 的海边别墅，或 Miami Beach 的临水地产。这些地方适合居住，而且你无法再创造出更多这样的地段。

如果你回到 100 年前，那一英亩地值大约 11 万美元；而 100 年后，那块地的价值变成了约 1000 万美元。快速计算一下你会发现，这正是每年增长 7% 的结果。

这也是为什么人们愿意花一亿美元买 Palm Beach 海边的房子。

我现在住的这所房子在 1930 年售出，我的墙上还挂着当年的契约，当时售价是 10 万美元。

如果你把这 10 万美元锁在保险箱里保存了 90 年，到今天拿出来，它也只能支付我这所房子 8 到 12 周的房产税。

也就是说——你根本无法靠这些钱撑过八周。

请继续。

**Host**:
Let me say it in my own words—tell me if this **resonates** with you: the reason you can’t store your money in cash is that the government, uh, **steals** your buying power by printing more of it.

I find it very **sobering** to look at it as **theft**.
Um... does that resonate with you, or do you think I’m being **hyperbolic**?

我来用我自己的方式说一下，你看看这是不是你认同的观点：你不能把钱以现金形式存起来，是因为政府通过印更多的钱，呃，偷走了你的购买力。

我觉得把这看作是一种偷窃，令人深思。

嗯……你认同这样的说法吗？还是觉得我太夸张了？

---

**Michael**: No, you're correct.

Uh, in essence, the inflation of the dollar supply means that **your wealth is cut in half every 10 years** if you hold all your wealth in cash. It's just—it's the **rule of 72**, right? You divide 7% into 72, and that gives you the half-life of the asset. So, the half-life of your wealth is 10 years **if you store it in cash**.

If someone gives you an asset you can invest in that goes up **7% a year**, you're **keeping up with inflation**. You're not getting wealthier, but you're also not getting poorer—you're just **treading water**.

And if you're **beating that hurdle rate**, then you're getting a bit wealthier.

Once you understand that, you realize that you can't preserve your wealth for long periods of time **in a fiat currency**—even the best fiat currency in the world, Tom, which is the U.S. dollar.

But in most other currencies, they're inflating at **14% a year**, which means the **half-life of your wealth is just five years**.

And in weak currencies like those in **Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Venezuela, or Argentina**, the inflation rate used to be **28–30% a year**, which means your wealth would halve in just **2–3 years**.

For example, take the **peso** — it went from **1 peso to the dollar to 1,000 pesos to the dollar over 20 years**.

不，你说得对。

本质上，美元供应量的通胀意味着——如果你把全部财富都以现金形式持有——你的财富每十年就会减少一半。这就是所谓的“72 法则”，你用 72 除以通胀率 7%，就得到了资产的半衰期。所以，现金的半衰期是十年。

如果有人给你一个每年增长 7% 的投资资产，那你只是跟上了通胀的步伐。你没有变富，也没有变穷，只是在原地踏步。

而如果你能超过这个门槛率（hurdle rate），你才算真正变得更富有了。

一旦你理解了这个道理，你就会明白，你无法通过持有法定货币长期保值——即使是全球最强的法币，比如美元。

在大多数其他货币体系中，通胀率大约是 每年 14%，这就意味着财富的半衰期只有五年。

在一些货币较弱的国家，比如土耳其、叙利亚、伊拉克、委内瑞拉、阿根廷，通胀率曾经是 28%-30% 每年，那意味着你的财富 2 到 3 年内就会缩水一半。

举个例子，比如比索（peso），它从过去的 1 比索兑 1 美元，变成了 1,000 比索兑 1 美元，只用了 20 年。

**Host**: Jesus.

**Michael**: Okay, so — you know, in America, you’ve got to keep in mind: you’re American. You live in **the greatest country of the last 100 years**.

America won every war. We were the winner of World War I — we got richer. We were the winner of World War II. We never lost a war. We were the **winners of the century**.

But even so, our **currency lost 99.9% of its economic power** over the last 100 years.

Now, if you go to Nigeria—or Germany — their currencies **crashed two or three times**.

In Japan, the currency crashed. In Russia, it crashed. The last time the Russian currency crashed was in 1998.

The **Brazilian currency** completely collapsed around 25 years ago. The **Argentine peso** has crashed about **four times** in the last 100 years.

So, if you’re an Argentinian and you’re only 30 years old, **you already know what hyperinflation feels like**, because you’ve lived through the entire cycle.

Americans, on the other hand, **don’t have that experience**.

So when you're taking advice from an American businessperson — like Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger — well, they didn’t live through the **Weimar Republic**, or the collapse of their own currency.

By the way, the currency collapsed in:

- Venezuela
- Argentina
- Brazil
- Cuba
- Russia
- **Every single country in Africa**

So **foreigners understand this better**.

Here’s what tends to happen:

The bank takes your money, the currency devalues to zero. The government promises everything’s okay and tells you to leave your money in the bank. Then they i**nflate the currency, freeze your account, crash the currency**, and finally tell you it’s **worthless**.

That’s what happened in **Cyprus**, not too long ago. (You can Google it.)

- So the real promise of Bitcoin is very simple:
  - **It’s a bank in cyberspace that won’t steal your money.**
  - **It’s an asset** you can store your **life savings** in — something no one can debase or corrupt.

And those are **two powerful promises** that — **for the first time in human history** — are now possible.

No one has ever given you both of those promises until now.

在美国，你要意识到自己生活在过去一百年最强大的国家。美国赢得了一战、二战，我们从未真正输过一场战争，可以说是世纪的赢家。

但即便如此，美元在过去 100 年中失去了 99.9%的购买力。

- 看看其他国家：
  - 德国、尼日利亚的货币崩溃过两三次；
  - 俄罗斯货币在 1998 年崩盘；
  - 巴西在 25 年前彻底货币崩溃；
  - 阿根廷在过去 100 年中货币崩盘了大约四次。

如果你是个 30 岁的阿根廷人，你就知道什么是恶性通胀，因为你亲身经历了整个过程。

但美国人没有那种经历，所以当你听从沃伦·巴菲特或查理·芒格这类美国商人的建议时，他们并没有经历过货币崩溃。

- 而比特币真正的承诺是什么？ 它是：
  - 一个网络中的银行，不会偷你的钱；
  - 一个可以安全储存一生积蓄的资产，不会被贬值或腐化。

这两个承诺是人类历史上前所未有的。

**Host:**

Yeah, the thing that—um, and a lot of this started with me getting to know you and researching cryptocurrency — was realizing the **absolute devastation** that’s happening even in America due to inflation.

And understanding this difference that you’re now explaining so clearly — until I started researching you for this episode, I’d **never heard you delineate it this way** — that **money is bifurcated into two elements**:

1. The money that you spend—cool.
2. But then there's the money that you're trying to **preserve your wealth with over time**.

When I tell people how they should think about their house, I say:

> Don’t think of your house as something that’s going to increase in value over time.
> Think of it more like an **insurance policy**—you're paying to maintain it, pay the property tax, and match inflation.

**Unless** your area becomes **disproportionately desirable** — and that does happen (like Austin, where prices went up because people flooded in)—then yes, value might increase significantly.

But for the most part, what you’ll actually see is:

> You’re just keeping up with **inflation**.

So as the **dollar is devalued**, it looks like the **price** of your house is going up—but the **real value** isn't necessarily increasing.

我开始研究加密货币、认识你之后，才意识到即使在美国，通胀也造成了巨大破坏。

你刚才说得非常清楚，我之前从没听你这样划分过：

> 金钱其实是分成两部分的——一部分是你日常支出的，另一部分是你想用来长期储存财富的。

我告诉别人怎么看待房子时会说：

> 不要把房子看作是一个会不断升值的资产，
> 要把它看作是你支付保险费用以应对维护成本和通胀的工具。

除非你所在地区变得特别受欢迎，比如奥斯汀（Austin）就是因为大量人迁入而涨价。

但大多数时候，房价的“上涨”只是在跟通胀赛跑。

也就是说，美元贬值了，你的房子看起来是涨价了，但实际价值并没有提升。

---

**Michael**:

I think that’s fair, by the way. I think that’s definitely a good way to think of it.

我觉得你说得很有道理。这确实是一个很好的思考方式。

---

**Host**:

Yeah, I think so. My thing — even in my own company — when I start talking about this stuff, my employees look at me a little bit like I’m crazy, because I’m so aggressive about getting people to understand it.

It’ll be really interesting to have this conversation with you, because ultimately, the **stock market is gambling**.

And once you understand that **people have been forced to become gamblers** due to inflation — that you have to find a way to **outpace inflation**, otherwise you lose your money — it really changes your outlook.

The really smart among us look at the capital system, look at the equities market, and they say,

> “Oh, cool. I have a complex way to find **arbitrage** — to find moments where, if I see an area of risk that I understand better than others, I can buy the asset, and when its value goes up, I can sell it for more than what inflation has eaten away.”

That **forces everyone to play the game** — or risk having their **buying power stripped away**.

And of course, that’s exactly what happens to the vast majority of people —** the so-called “normal” or undereducated** — they’re just going to get eaten alive, because they don’t have the time, energy, or intellect to figure out this **relatively complicated game**.

Okay, so with all of that as the structure—the **why** even the average person should care about this to a screaming degree—

There’s an idea that you say, but you kind of **go by it quickly**, and I think if people really understood it, it could help them a lot.

You’ve said, _“I want to see the entire world recapitalize in Bitcoin.”_

Now when you say **“recapitalize**,” do you mean:

> That the portion of your wealth you want to store — to **maintain purchasing power over time** — should move **out of real estate**, **out of treasuries**, **out of equities**, and instead be moved i**nto Bitcoin**?

Is that what you mean?

我在公司谈这些话题时，员工常常觉得我有点疯狂，因为我特别激进地希望大家理解这些事情。

但这次和你谈，真的很有意义。因为股市本质上是赌博。

一旦你意识到，人们是被迫成为赌徒的——通胀迫使你必须跑赢通胀，否则你会失去财富。

聪明人会研究资本体系和股票市场，然后说：

> “太好了，我可以在一些我理解比别人更深的风险区域里，找到套利机会，买入资产，等它升值后卖出，只要比通胀吃掉的多，就能获利。”

这就逼迫所有人都必须玩这个游戏，否则就只能看着自己的购买力被一点点剥夺。

而这正是大多数普通人——尤其是教育水平较低的人——的处境。
他们没有时间、精力或能力去理解这个复杂的财富游戏，结果就是被这个系统“活活吃掉”。

所以，这也解释了为什么连普通人都必须认真对待这件事。

你曾说过一句话，

> “我希望看到全世界都用比特币重新资本化。”

但你说得很快，我觉得大家如果真的理解这句话，会很受启发。

所以我想问的是：
你说的“重新资本化”，是不是指：

> 把你想要保值的那部分财富，从房地产、国债、股票中撤出来，
> 然后转移到比特币上？

你的意思是这样吗？

---

**Michael**:

Yeah, that’s a good way to say it.

Yeah, you’ve **articulated** that quite well.

Yes — **recapitalize, build**.

Build your house on a **firm foundation**. Don’t build it on **sinking sand**, don’t build it on a **swamp** — build it on **granite rock**, on **schist** (a type of solid rock).

If I could give you the math:

If you’re capitalized in **U.S. dollars**, and you go buy **Treasury bonds**, the so-called **risk-free rate** is tied to SOFR—the **Standard Overnight Funding Rate**.

That rate **fluctuates**, but say you earn **5%**, and then you get taxed.

After taxes, you might keep **3%**.

If you’re in a **tax-free** environment, maybe you keep **4.5%**.

But generally, if you’re taxed, you’re looking at **around 3%**.

So, the **risk-free rate of return** on capital held in dollars is in the **3% range**.

Now compare that to Bitcoin.

The **risk-free rate for Bitcoin**, based on the last 21 years of performance, is about **29–30% annualized**.

So the way I look at investments is this:

> If you're pitching me an idea, I already have a large portion of my capital in **Bitcoin**, and I’m expecting **30% risk-free** over the next 20 years.

So your investment needs to **beat that**:

- It needs to return more than 30%,
- **Plus** a risk premium,
- **Plus** tax efficiency.

If you offer me something that makes **50% a year**, but it’s taxable, then maybe I net **40%**, or **35%**.

And after risk and taxes, I’m like,

> _“Well, that’s still not better than my ‘risk-free’ 30% from Bitcoin.”_

So, if you're **capitalized on Bitcoin**, if you understand it,and if you have a **long time horizon** — meaning you’ll hold it for more than four years — then you don’t care about the volatility.

All you care about is the **annualized return**.

你刚才的说法很好，很清晰。

是的，要“重新资本化”，要“建立”（Build）。

你应该把你的“房子”（财富）建在坚实的地基上，而不是建在流沙或沼泽上。应该建在花岗岩上。

如果我们谈一下数学：

如果你持有的是美元资产，比如买国债，那么所谓的无风险利率大概接近 SOFR（标准隔夜融资利率）。

假设你获得了 5% 的年收益，扣完税你大概只能拿到 3%；

如果是免税环境，可能能拿到 4.5%。

所以，美元体系下的无风险收益大概就是 3% 左右。

而 比特币的无风险收益率——根据过去 21 年的数据——是 年化约 29–30%。

所以我看投资的方式是这样的：

> 你向我推销一个投资机会？
> 我已经有大量资金在比特币中，我期望未来 20 年年化有 30% 的“无风险”收益。

所以你提供的投资必须：

- 高于 30%，
- 再加上 风险溢价，
- 再加上 税务优化后的回报。

如果你告诉我某个项目年化收益 50%，但要交税，最后可能只剩 40% 或 35%，
那我会想：

> “这其实还不如我拿比特币的 30% 安稳。”

如果你真的理解比特币、有长期持有的视角（比如超过四年），你就不会在意波动，你只关心一个数字：

> 年化回报率。

---

**Host:**

There are **a lot of assumptions** in there.

So I know a lot of people are probably **clutching their pearls** right now — about **Bitcoin being referred to as “risk-free.”**

So can you break it down for us?

What’s the difference between **volatility** and **risk**?

And how can you have the confidence to look at Bitcoin and say,

> “No, no, no — the risk is merely a **timeline question**.”

Because I think a lot of people will take exception to that idea.

你刚刚讲的内容里，有很多前提假设。

我知道现在肯定有不少人听到你说**比特币是“无风险”资产**时，已经开始“抓胸口”了（表示震惊）。

所以你能不能给我们解释一下：

- “波动性” 和 “风险” 之间的区别是什么？
- 你又是如何有信心说：
  - > “不不不，风险只是一个时间维度的问题。”

因为我相信很多人对这点是会提出质疑的。

---

**Michael:**
Yeah, so—well, the **dollar** has **zero ARR** (Annual Rate of Return) and **zero volatility**.

That is to say:

- The dollar goes up **0%** against itself each year.
- It also has **zero volatility** — because it’s not fluctuating against itself.

So if you’re holding dollars, you’re living in **flatland**.
You’re like a **stationary pedestrian** in a two-dimensional world.

**Bitcoin**, on the other hand, is going up **60% a year** against the dollar.

**For how long?**

Well, since MicroStrategy made its first investment four years ago, it’s been up **60% annually**.

But if you stretch it back **6, 8, even 10 years**, you’ll see that **Bitcoin has averaged around 60% annual growth**.

So over a **decade**, it’s held that growth rate.

And yes, it also has **60% volatility**.
So it’s a **“60/60 asset”**—60% return, 60% volatility—**against the dollar**.

Here’s how you should think of it:

> Imagine you’re on a **speeding train going 60 miles per hour**, and there’s a **flywheel spinning at 60 RPM**.
> Meanwhile, the person standing in “flatland” (holding dollars) is just watching the train rush by.
> They think, _“This is scary—it’s going to suck the oxygen out of my lungs!”_

But the reality is — they’re just standing still.

Their money is going **nowhere** — it earns **0%**.

So they have a **very different perspective** on money compared to someone riding the **Bitcoin train**.

Let’s take a concrete example:

- Someone with **$1 million in cash** is going to have **$1 million in cash** ten years from now.
- Someone with **$1 million in Bitcoin**, based on historical performance, is going to **double their capital every 18 months** — just by **holding** it.

So over ten years, they’d double it **four times** (approximately):

- $1M → $2M → $4M → $8M → $16M

That’s the difference in **trajectory**.

And so, when people get scared about **volatility**, they miss the bigger picture:

> The volatility is real—but it **comes down to a question of time horizon**.

美元的年化回报率是 0%，波动率也是 0%，因为它不会“对自己”升值或贬值。
你持有美元就像生活在一个“二维的平面世界”里，静止不动。

而比特币，过去四年（MicroStrategy 投资以来）年化回报约 60%；
回看过去 6 到 10 年，平均年化也是 60%，波动率也是 60%。

所以它是一个 60/60 的资产——60% 年化回报 + 60% 波动率。

可以把它比作：

> 你坐在一列以 60 英里每小时飞驰的火车上，火车内部还有一个每分钟旋转 60 次的飞轮，而持有美元的人，就像在原地站着的行人，看着火车呼啸而过，吓得不敢靠近，觉得这太“危险”。

但事实是，美元根本不涨，持有它十年后仍是原地踏步。

而你如果用一百万美元买入比特币，按历史表现，每 18 个月翻一倍：

- 1M → 2M → 4M → 8M → 16M（十年四次翻倍）

所以真正的问题不在于波动性本身，

> 而是你有没有足够的时间视角来看待它。

---

**Host:**

Sorry—and I’ll let you get back to that—but this does come down to a belief:

When you look into the future, the **setup that gives Bitcoin a 60% annual return** is going to **continue**.

Because when I look at it, I say—

> The only reason Bitcoin has that kind of **reward** is **because it’s volatile**.
> There are **question marks** around it.

And if there were no question marks — if it were fully accepted —
**everyone would flood in almost instantly**, the price would spike, and eventually it would **hit homeostasis**.

And that would be the end of these outsized returns.

So, I don’t think **Bitcoin is risk-free** at all.

But I do think the **volatility is advantageous** — for the people who are **right**.

If people are right about its upside potential, then that volatility **rewards** them fairly.

So let me ask:

**Why do you think the best way to conceptualize Bitcoin is as “risk-free”?**

不好意思，打断一下，但我觉得这归根结底是一个“信念”的问题：

当你看向未来，你要相信让比特币维持 60% 年化回报率 的机制会继续存在。

但在我看来，比特币有这种高回报的唯一原因，是因为它具有高波动性、存在很多不确定性。

如果没有这些问号——如果大家都接受它，那所有人都会立刻蜂拥而入，价格会飙升，然后市场就会进入稳定状态（homeostasis），高回报也就结束了。

所以我不认为比特币是“无风险”的。

但我确实认为，波动性对那些判断正确的人是有利的。

如果你赌对了它的上涨潜力，那这些波动就是你应得的奖励。

所以我想问你：

> 为什么你觉得最好的方式是把比特币看作一个“无风险资产”？

---

**Michael:**

Howard Marks would say:

> **Volatility is not risk. Volatility is volatility.**

A **merry-go-round**, or a **carnival ride**, or a **roller coaster** — those things are **volatile**.

But **risk** is something different.

Risk is what happens **if you fly off the roller coaster**, or **if the merry-go-round stops working**, or **if the ride breaks down**.

So the **fundamental risk** of Bitcoin is the **existential risk** — the potential for an **extinction-level event**.

For example:

- If **space aliens** come down and say, _“We’re taking your Bitcoin away,”_ well, then I guess there’s risk.
- Or if some **evil genius** invents a **cyber virus** that **instantly and irreversibly destroys** the Bitcoin network—that’s a risk.

But that's like the **existential risk** you take in **everyday life**:

- When you **get on an airplane**, the risk is: it could crash.
- When you **cross the street**, the risk is: you could get hit.
- When you **eat food**, the risk is: what if someone poisoned it?

If you say, _“Can you imagine this food hurting me?”_
I’d say, _“Yeah, if I put poison in it, you’re dead.”_

So the real question is:

> **Do you trust the system? Do you trust the chef? Do you trust the waiter?**

Yes, there’s **some risk** in life.
And in the case of Bitcoin, the **existential risk** is some **world-ending event** that wipes it out.

But **short of that, volatility is just motion**, not danger.

Howard Marks 说得好：

> 波动性不是风险，波动性就是波动性。

旋转木马、游乐场的过山车，这些都**很波动**，但它们本身不是风险。
**真正的风险**是你从过山车上飞出去、机器坏了、无法停止等事件。

比特币的**根本风险**是它面临的“灭绝级事件”，也就是存在性风险：

比如：

- 外星人降临，说：“我们要拿走你们的比特币。”——那当然是风险。
- 或者有个邪恶天才制造出一种网络病毒，能立刻摧毁比特币网络且无法恢复——这就是风险。

但这些风险就像你日常生活中要承担的“存在性风险”：

- 你坐飞机 → 有坠机风险；
- 你过马路 → 有被撞风险；
- 你吃饭 → 如果有人投毒 → 你就死了。

所以问题不是“有没有风险”，
而是你问自己：

> “我信任这个系统吗？我信任厨师或服务员吗？”

没错，人生中总是有一些风险。
而对比特币来说，除非发生那种毁灭级事件，
否则所谓的“风险”其实只是价格的波动，而不是真正的危险。

**Host:**

There’s another layer of risk—not existential—but still important.

You’re referring to Bitcoin as having a **"risk-free return" of 60%**, but I think what feels off to a lot of people is the **assumption** that it will continue performing at that rate.

Even **you** have said that over the next 21 years, it’s expected to come down—that it will **average out** to around **29% annualized return**.

But what if that **slowdown happens faster** than expected?
What if the actual return ends up being **substantially** lower than that?

Now, I understand saying that Bitcoin **has a better chance** of delivering a **higher return** than, say, the **S&P 500**, which we might estimate at **around 15%**.

So maybe it **won’t hit 60%** consistently, but it also probably **won’t drop below 15%** — and if 15% is our **hurdle rate**, then it’s reasonable to say Bitcoin could outperform.

**However**, I think the part where people **get uncomfortable** with your language is this **idea of inevitability** — the **assumption** that 60% is somehow guaranteed.

**What would you say to that?**

这里还有一层风险，虽然不是“存在性风险”，但仍然重要。

你说比特币的“无风险回报是 60%”，但很多人听起来觉得这有些问题，
因为这背后带有一个假设：比特币未来依然会维持这个回报水平。

你自己也说过，未来 21 年的年化回报可能会降到约 29%。

但如果这个下滑来得更快呢？
如果实际回报比预期的低很多呢？

当然，我理解你说的意思是：

> 比特币未来可能比 S&P 500（标普 500 指数）表现更好， 而我们可能把标普年化收益估算在 15% 左右， 即便比特币达不到 60%，可能也不会低于 15%，如果我们设定的“门槛收益率”是 15%，那么比特币还是有望跑赢。

但问题在于，很多人对你用“60%”这个数字时的语气有点不舒服——
因为这听起来好像你在说这个回报是不可避免的、几乎是保证的。

## 你会怎么回应这种质疑？

**Michael:**

So we’re really dealing with **three concepts** here: **risk**, **volatility**, and **performance**.

I’ve already addressed **risk** by pointing out that there is always some **existential risk** in any given network or system—whether it's Bitcoin, fiat currencies, or traditional finance.

But once you understand and accept that level of risk, you need to ask:

> What’s the source of **volatility**?
> What’s the source of **performance**?

If you **don’t understand** the underlying mechanics — what I call **economic physics** — then Bitcoin looks **random**.

And when you don’t understand why an asset performs the way it does, you’ll **mistake volatility for risk**, and you'll assume the performance is just **luck** or **chance**.

Let me give you a **metaphor** to help explain it.

---

## The Mountain Lake Analogy

Imagine I’m a **hiker** who stumbles upon a **mountain lake** —
It holds **500 trillion gallons of water**, it’s **clear** and **cold**, and there’s a **waterfall** flowing from it.

- The water in the lake is calm.
- The waterfall is **turbulent** — it’s **volatile**.

If I don’t understand where that water came from or how it moves, I might say:

> “This waterfall is wild! What if it stops falling downhill?”
> “This is too volatile for me!”

So maybe I take a selfie, go for a swim, get cold, and leave.

But suppose I’m not just a tourist—I’m an **engineer**.

Now, I start to **understand the system**:

- The **sun** shines on the **ocean**
- Water **evaporates**
- It **rises**, **condenses**, and **rains** into the mountains
- That fills the **mountain lake**
- The water flows **downhill** due to **gravity**

I realize:

> “Ah! This system has **structure**, **momentum**, and **energy**. It’s not random.”

So what do I do?

**I build a dam.**

I install a **turbine** and **generate electricity**.

Then I power a **village** or a **city**.

If someone says,

> “What happens when the water stops flowing downhill?”
> I say:
> “Gravity. Newton solved that one.”

If someone asks,

> “What happens when the lake runs dry?”
> I answer:
> “There’s **500 trillion gallons** in the lake—and the sun keeps shining on the ocean. The system is sustainable.”

## Bitcoin Is the Waterfall

Now let’s tie that metaphor to **Bitcoin**:

- The **500 trillion gallons of water** = **$500 trillion of global capital**
- That capital is currently stuck in **real estate**, s**overeign debt**, **corporate bonds**, f**iat currencies**, **artwork**, and **equities in unstable countries**
- It’s held in **warehouses** that are **depreciating**, or in **currencies in crisis zones** like **Cuba**, **Venezuela**, **Nigeria**, etc.

So there’s a **natural force** — call it **economic gravity** — that causes capital to **flow** from **high-energy**, **low-efficiency systems** to **low-energy**, **high-efficiency systems**.

Bitcoin is that **lower-energy state**.
It’s more **thermodynamically sound**.
Capital wants to flow **downhill** into it.

It’s not an accident that **Bitcoin is going up**—it’s because:

- Capital is seeking **efficiency**
- Inflation, war, entropy, and time are **devaluing traditional assets**
- Bitcoin represents a **more energy-efficient storage of value**

## Why Is Bitcoin Volatile?

Because Bitcoin is open, liquid, and **always trading**.

Unlike:

- **Real estate** you can’t sell at 3am
- **Picassos** you can’t trade on weekends
- **Apartments** that don’t have 100x leverage on global exchanges

With Bitcoin:

- On a **Saturday night**, someone can place a **$10 billion short bet** with **100x leverage** during a geopolitical scare
- Then **reverse the position** Sunday morning when the crisis passes

No other asset on Earth allows that kind of behavior.
And **that** is why Bitcoin is **volatile** —

> Not because it’s broken, but because it’s **the most liquid**, **most accessible**, and **most useful capital market instrument** in the world.

So yes, **volatility is a feature**, not a bug.
It’s a result of Bitcoin’s **usefulness**, its **openness**, and its **efficiency** in absorbing and redistributing capital.

And once you understand that—once you stop seeing performance and volatility as random—you realize:

**Bitcoin’s growth isn’t luck. It’s physics.**

我们要讨论的其实是三个核心概念：

1. **风险（Risk）**
2. **波动性（Volatility）**
3. **表现/回报（Performance）**

#### 用“山湖瀑布”作比喻：

- 湖水是**稳定的资本**（500 万亿美金）
- 瀑布是**资本从低效资产流向高效资产的过程**（比特币）
- 重力 = 经济逻辑（资本自然想“往低能耗、更高效”的方向流动）
- 工程师（懂机制的人）就会用这个系统发电（比喻：利用波动性创造回报）
- 只要**太阳还照耀海洋、水循环还继续**，这个系统就能**长期运作**

---

#### 为什么比特币表现好？

因为它**不是随机现象**，它是资本在寻找**更低能耗、更高效率的状态**。

相比之下，许多传统资产：

- 被通胀吞噬
- 被战争摧毁
- 被腐烂和时间削弱

---

#### 为什么比特币波动这么大？

因为它：

- **开放交易**（24/7）
- **全球杠杆**（100 倍）
- **交易量大、深度强**

也就是说——

> 如果你能在周六晚下 100 倍杠杆空头，然后周日早上又反转做多，那当然波动性大！
> 这在股票、房产、艺术品市场根本不可能发生。

**所以波动性不是比特币的缺陷，而是它作为全球最有效资本市场的体现。**
