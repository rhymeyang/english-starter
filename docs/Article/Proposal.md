### 1. **Raspberry Pi and Arduino-Based CAN Bus Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**

- Use Raspberry Pi as the central IDS and Arduino as CAN nodes to simulate an automotive network.
- Monitor CAN traffic for anomalies (e.g., spoofing or flooding) and alert when malicious behavior is detected.
- Employ Raspberry Pi for logging and analysis.

------

### 2. **Encrypted CAN Communication Between Raspberry Pi and Arduino**

- Implement secure communication between Raspberry Pi and Arduino using the MCP2515 CAN module.
- Raspberry Pi acts as a monitoring node, and Arduino simulates ECUs, with messages encrypted to prevent tampering.
- Demonstrate encryption's impact on latency and performance.

------

### 3. **Simulating Automotive CAN Attacks**

- Set up Raspberry Pi and Arduino to simulate an automotive CAN network.
- Raspberry Pi simulates a hacker's device performing fuzzing or replay attacks, while Arduino nodes represent ECUs.
- Analyze vulnerabilities and propose mitigation strategies.

------

### 4. **CAN Logger for Automotive Diagnostics**

- Use Arduino to capture CAN traffic from an automotive system and send data to Raspberry Pi for analysis.
- Raspberry Pi processes and visualizes data, identifying patterns and anomalies in real time.
- Useful for cybersecurity or performance analysis in vehicles.

------

### 5. **Remote Monitoring and Alert System for CAN Networks**

- Set up a Raspberry Pi to receive and log data from Arduino nodes via the CAN bus.
- Implement a web interface on Raspberry Pi for remote access to CAN logs and real-time threat alerts.
- Ideal for remote diagnostics and monitoring of vehicle security.
