## Review of Lesson 1

Nowadays more tasks at home and work are being performed by robots.

Why do you think this is happening?

Is it a positive or negative development?

---

**Robotics increasingly play a role both in the home and the workplace.** This is due to advancements in technology and it should be seen as a positive development because it reduces a person's workload.

## Using Our Introduction as a 'Mini-Plan'

Robotics increasingly play a role both in the home and the workplace.

## This is due to advancements in technology and it should be seen as a positive development because it reduces a person's workload.

Main Body 1- This is occurring because of advancements in technology (1 idea)

Main Body 2- and it should be seen as a positive development because it reduces a person's workload. (1 idea)

## What is a main body paragraph?

- This is the most important part. Think of it as the meat in the hamburger.
- This is where you will make your detailed argument. This is where you will prove your point.
- This is where you set out your main points and develop them fully.

## Three Elements of a Main Body Paragraph.

1. Topic Sentences
2. Explanations
3. Examples

## Topic Sentence

- Tells the reader what the paragraph is about.
- Essential for Task Response, but also for Coherence and Cohesion.
  - 这不仅对任务回应至关重要，对连贯性和衔接性也同样重要。
- Should be short and simple. Does not need to be a complex sentence.

---

- Many people worry about 'repetition' here.
- You lose marks for repeating words/phrases, not ideas.
- Deploy paraphrasing again.

---

Nowadays more tasks at home and work are being performed by robots.

Why do you think this is happening?

This is occurring because of advancements in technology

People rely on machines because of the latest developments in machine learning.

## Explanations

- Never assume that the reader knows what your topic sentence means or that they know how it answers the question.
- The reader can't ask you any follow up questions, so you must explain everything.
- Pretend you are explaining it to someone who knows nothing about the topic.

---

So what?!?

How would you explain this to someone who knows nothing about the topic?

---

People rely on machines because of the latest developments in machine learning.

What is machine learning?

What developments?

How have those developments allowed this to happen?

Why? Result? Consequences?

---

People rely on machines because of the latest developments in machine learning.

This is because big data and the fact that we are all connected via the internet means that algorithms can learn basic tasks. As a result, software does not need to be programmed but can learn from millions of other devices around the world. For example.....

## Examples

- The examiners want you to demonstrate that you know how to use examples.
- The examples must support or prove your main points.
- Think about when you are arguing with someone and you use an example to help win the argument.

---

- Newspaper/magazine story.
- YouTube video.
- Personal examples are OK, but be careful.

---

- Again, think about explaining it to someone who knows nothing.
- What would you use to help illustrate this to an alien from a different planet?

## Warning!

- I Do not worry if this is not making complete sense right now.
- This is going to take further implementation and practice.
- For example, in IELTS VIP we do a whole module on examples, plus we look at each of the 5 essay types individually. We also have FB live videos on examples in the VIP Facebook group.

## Paragraph 1

**This is because big data and the fact that we are all connected via the internet means that algorithms can learn basic tasks. As a result, software does not need to be programmed but can learn from millions of other devices around the world.** For example, Tesla cars now come with Autopilot, which drives the car itself and shares the data with all other Tesla vehicles.

## Example

People rely on machines because of the latest developments in machine learning. This is because big data and the fact that we are all connected via the internet means that algorithms can learn basic tasks. As a result, software does not need to be programmed but can learn from millions of other devices around the world by sharing information and teaching one another. For example, Tesla cars now come with Autopilot, which drives the car itself and shares the data with all other Tesla vehicles.

## Paragraph 2

Is it a positive or negative development?

Main idea- positive because reduces workload.

Explanation- Al does boring, repetitive tasks freeing up time to do other things.

Examples- Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Uber, Netflix.

## Demo

Automation should be welcomed because it frees people from the **drudgery** of everyday duties. Our day to day lives are dominated by menial, repetitive chores that take up much of our time. Automating these is possible and technological solutions allow us to focus on more meaningful activities. For example, there is now a robot that both cuts grass and hoovers carpets and the manufacturers estimate that this will save the average person 3 weeks per year. **Owners are free to choose what to do with these extra hours instead of being forced to carry out routine work.**

- drudgery: 英 /ˈdrʌdʒəri/, 美 /ˈdrʌdʒəri/
  - n. 苦工;贱役;单调沉闷的工作
- menial: 英 /'miːnɪəl/, 美 /'minjəl/
  - adj. (指工作)卑贱的,不体面的
  - n. (干粗活的)家仆
- "hoovers" (as a brand name)

---

- 自动化应该受到欢迎，因为它使人们摆脱日常琐事的单调乏味。我们的日常生活被琐碎、重复的家务主导，占据了大量时间。自动化这些任务是可行的，技术解决方案使我们能够专注于更有意义的活动。例如，现在有一种机器人可以同时割草和吸尘，制造商估计这将为普通人每年节省三周的时间。
  - Automation should be welcomed because it frees people from the **drudgery** of everyday duties. Our **day-to-day** lives are dominated by menial, repetitive chores that take up much of our time. Automating these is possible, and technological solutions allow us to focus on more meaningful activities. For example, there is now a robot that both cuts grass and vacuums carpets, and the manufacturers estimate that this will save the average person three weeks per year.

## Homework Task

Look at the question below. Follow the steps outlined in this lesson and write a main body.

Nowadays artificial intelligence is being used to drive cars.

Why is this happening?

Is it a positive or negative development?

- 我相信要有同情心，但你们中的许多人需要听到真相，那就是——你们会失败！
  - I believe in being compassionate, but many of you need the truth, which is—you're going to fail!

## Lack of Cohesion

Recently, many automobile vehicles are being driven by artificial intelligence. This is due to the **advancements in technology**. It should be considered as a positive trend because it reduces road traffic accidents.

An automobile industry positively encouraging using developed technology like artificial intelligence in order to **manufacture more efficient cars than in past**. Day by day, Human beings are unveiling new horizons of science, an autonomous vehicle is the best example of it. A recent study found that majority of people are inclining towards driverless cars.

## Sample

Artificial intelligence is being introduced to many vehicles to reduce the number of road traffic accidents. This is because thousands of people are killed on our roads every year and AI can control cars better than human beings. The software scans oncoming threats using a variety of sensors and can even anticipate collisions before they happen. For example, Google has developed a driverless car and after testing it on public roads, it has only had one accident, while driving millions of miles. The same number of miles driven by humans would have resulted in many more serious injuries and fatalities.

---

This should be seen as a negative development because of the number of jobs that will be lost. Automation will always be more attractive to companies and consumers because it is much cheaper than human labor. Drivers account for a large proportion of the workforce in any economy and removing them will result in mass unemployment because they will be replaced by machines. For instance, Uber is developing new driverless taxis that will not require a person to operate them and it is estimated that this could lead to around 300,000 taxi and Uber drivers losing their livelihoods in the UK alone.

2. How to write effective main body paragraphs
3. How to complete our essay

## Review of Question

Nowadays more tasks at home and work are being performed by robots.

Why do you think this is happening?

Is it a positive or negative development?

**Robotics increasingly play a role both in the home and the workplace.** This is occurring because of advancements in technology and it should be seen as a positive development because it reduces a person's workload.

## What is a conclusion?

- This is where we state our opinion.
- This is where we summarise our main ideas.
- Read any academic paper and you'll be able to find the main points in the introduction and the conclusion.

## But there is no opinion!?!

- Every question is asking for your opinion.
- What are the advantages and disadvantages?
- Why is this?
  - Is it a positive or negative development?

## Three Elements of a Conclusion.

1. Cohesive Device
2. Opinion
3. Summary of Main Ideas
4. 衔接手段
5. 观点
6. 主要观点总结

## Cohesive Device

- You are only going to write one conclusion in your IELTS Writing test, so learn just one way to start your conclusion
- In conclusion,
- To conclude,

## Reiterate Your Opinion

Do not worry about repetition.

- addresses all parts of the task
- presents a clear position throughout the response
- presents, extends and supports main ideas, but there may be a tendency to overgeneralise, and/or supporting ideas may lack focus

## Paraphrasing

- I Do not worry about repeating your main ideas again, but this does not mean that you can copy the same words.
- We take our main ideas from the introduction and we paraphrase them.
- The makes it very simple to write a conclusion and ensures your position is clear throughout.

## Summary of Main Ideas

- Someone should be able to read your conclusion only and tell what your main ideas are.
- Again, don't worry about repeating your main ideas, but you must paraphrase.
- This will make the conclusion easy to write and ensure you summarise your main ideas.

## Demo

Robotics increasingly play a role both in the home and in the workplace. This is occurring because of advancements in technology and it should be seen as a positive development because it reduces a person's workload.

In conclusion, machines carry out tasks for us due to the fact that engineers and computer scientists are pushing the boundaries of science and engineering and these innovations should be welcomed because they emancipate humankind from routine **toil**.

Always check the question again.

## Remember

The examiner should be able to look at your conclusion ONLY and understand that you have understood the question, that you have a clear position and what your main ideas are to support that position.

Do that, and you'll write an excellent conclusion.

## Why you need to proofread...
