The IELTS Writing test has two formats: **Academic** and **General Training**. Here’s a comparison of the differences between them:

### 1. Purpose

- **Academic**: For people applying to higher education or professional registration. It assesses readiness to study or train in an English-speaking academic environment.
- **General Training**: For those going to English-speaking countries for secondary education, work experience, or training programs. It focuses on basic survival skills in a broad social and educational context.

### 2. Structure

Both versions have two tasks, but the types of tasks differ:

#### **Task 1**

- **Academic**: You’ll describe, summarize, or explain information in a graph, table, chart, or diagram. The task requires an analytical and factual style to discuss trends, differences, or steps in a process.
- **General Training**: You’ll write a letter, usually informal or semi-formal, based on a given situation (e.g., apologizing, requesting information, or explaining something). This task tests everyday written communication skills.

#### **Task 2 (Essay)**

- **Both Academic and General Training**: You’ll write an essay responding to a point of view, argument, or problem. This part is the same for both tests, but **Academic** tasks often require a more formal tone and are more geared toward analytical or opinion-based essays, while **General Training** topics may be more about everyday issues.

### 3. Tone and Style

- **Academic**: Typically more formal and impersonal. Use a professional tone with formal vocabulary and structure.
- **General Training**: Often a bit more relaxed, especially in Task 1, where an informal tone may be acceptable depending on the context. Task 2 essays can also be slightly more conversational, but formal writing is still expected.

### 4. Scoring and Word Count

- **Word Count**: Both tests require at least 150 words for Task 1 and at least 250 words for Task 2.
- **Scoring Criteria**: Both are scored on four criteria: Task Achievement/Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. However, for **Academic Task 1**, there’s a stronger emphasis on accurately interpreting data.

### Summary Table

| Aspect       | Academic                             | General Training                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Task 1**   | Describe data (graphs, charts, etc.) | Write a letter (formal, informal, etc.)     |
| **Task 2**   | Formal essay                         | Semi-formal/formal essay                    |
| **Tone**     | More formal                          | May be informal in Task 1, formal in Task 2 |
| **Audience** | Academic/professional                | General/social                              |

In summary, **IELTS Academic** is more formal and data-driven, suited to higher education or professional contexts, while **IELTS General Training** assesses practical, everyday writing skills.
