## PART 2

### Describe a creative person whose work you admire.

You should say:

- Who he/she is
- How you knew him/her
- What creative things he/she has done
- And explain why you think he/she is creative

One creative person whose work I really admire is J.K.
Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series. She has **an incredible talent** for creating a detailed and magical world that has **captured the hearts of millions of readers** all over the world. Her **imagination and storytelling skills** are truly one of a kind.

I first discovered her work when I read Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone as a child. From the very first page, I was **hooked**. The magical world she created, with its wizards, witches, and Hogwarts School, was **unlike anything l'd ever read before**. I loved the idea of hidden magic in everyday life and quickly **became obsessed with the series**, reading each book as soon as it was released.

J.K. Rowling hasn't just written books; she has achieved a lot more. She wrote the Fantastic Beasts **film scripts**, which expand on the magical world she created. In addition to her work in film, she has also been involved in creating **stage productions**. This has allowed fans to experience her magical world in a completely new way. Outside of writing, she's **involved in charity work**, supporting children in need.

What I admire most about her is how her stories go beyond just being fun to read. They explore themes like **loyalty**, **bravery**, and **standing up for what's right**.
Her characters feel so real, and their struggles and friendships are things **people of all ages can relate to**.
That's what makes her such a **creative and inspiring** person.
