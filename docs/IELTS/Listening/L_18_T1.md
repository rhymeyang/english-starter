## 18 Test1 听力 Part3

- Hugo：Hi Chantal.
  - What did you think of the talk, then?
  - 那么，你觉得这次谈话怎么样?
- Chantal：Hi Hugo.
  - I thought it was good once I’d moved seats.
  - 我移动了座位之后，觉得还不错。
- Hugo：Oh – were the people beside you chatting or something?
  - 哦，你旁边的人在聊天吗?
- Chantal：It wasn’t that.
  - 不是那样的。
  - I went early so that I’d get a seat and not have to stand, but then this guy sat right in front of me and he was so tall!(Q21)
  - 我去得很早，这样我就能找个座位，不用站着，但是有个人就坐在我前面，他太高了！
- Hugo： It’s hard to see through people’s heads, isn’t it?
  - 头挡住什么也看不见，是吗？
- Chantal：Impossible!不可能!
  - Anyway, to answer your question, I thought it was really interesting, especially what the speaker said about the job market.
  - 不管怎样，回答你的问题，我认为这真的很有趣，尤其是演讲者谈到的就业市场。
- Hugo：Me too.我也是。
  - I mean we know we’re going into a really competitive field so it’s obvious that we may struggle to get work.
  - 我的意思是，我们知道我们将进入一个竞争非常激烈的领域，所以很明显，我们可能很难找到工作。
- Chantal：That’s right – and we know we can’t all have that ‘dream job’.
  - 没错，我们也知道不是所有人都能拥有‘理想的工作’。
- Hugo：Yeah, but it looks like there’s a whole range of … areas of work that we hadn’t even thought of(Q22) – like fashion journalism, for instance.
  - 是的，但看起来有很多我们从未想过的工作领域，比如时尚新闻。”
- Chantal：Yeah – I wasn’t expecting so many career options.就是说，我没想到会有这么多职业选择。
- Hugo：Mmm.
  - Overall, she had quite a strong message, didn’t she?
  - 总的来说，她传达了一个很强烈的信息，不是吗?
- Chantal：She did.
  - She kept saying things like ‘I know you all think this, but …’ and then she’d tell us how it really is.
  - 的确。她一直在说“我知道你们都这么想，但是………”。然后她会告诉我们真实情况是什么。
- Hugo：Perhaps she thinks students are a bit narrow-minded about the industry.
  - 也许她认为学生们对这个行业的看法有点狭隘。
- Chantal：It was a bit harsh, though!(Q23)不过，有点苛刻!
  - We know it’s a tough industry.(Q23)我们知道这是一个艰难的行业。
- Hugo：Yeah – and we’re only first years, after all. (Q23)是啊，毕竟我们才一年级。
  - We’ve got a lot to learn.(Q23)
  - 我们有很多东西要学。
- Chantal：Exactly.
  - Do you think our secondary-school education should have been more career-focused?
  - 你认为我们的中学教育应该更注重职业发展吗?
- Hugo：Well, we had numerous talks on careers, which was good, but none of them were very inspiring.(Q24)
  - “嗯，我们谈了很多关于职业的话题，这很好，但没有一个是非常鼓舞人心的。
  - They could have asked more people like today’s speaker to talk to us.(Q24)
  - 他们本可以邀请更多像今天的演讲者这样的人来和我们交流。
- Chantal：I agree.
  - We were told about lots of different careers – just when we needed to be, but not by the experts who really know stuff.
  - 他们只是在我们需要的时候告诉我们关于许多不同职业的事情，但那些人不是真正了解职场的专家。
- Hugo：So did today’s talk influence your thoughts on what career you’d like to take up in the future?
  - 那么今天的谈话是否影响了你对未来职业的想法?”
- Chantal：Well, I promised myself that I’d go through this course and keep an open mind till the end.(Q25)
  - 好吧，我答应过我自己会完成这门课程并保持开放的心态直到最后。
- Hugo：But I think it’s better to pick an area of the industry now and then aim to get better and better at it.(Q25)
  - 但我认为最好是现在就选择一个行业领域，然后努力在这个领域做得越来越好。
- Chantal：Well, I think we’ll just have to differ on that issue!(Q25)
  - 好吧，我想我们只能在这个问题上有不同意见了!”
- Hugo：One thing’s for certain, though. From what she said, we’ll be unpaid assistants in the industry for quite a long time.
  - 不过，有一件事是肯定的。按照她的说法，我们会作为助手在这个行业工作很长一段时间，但是没有薪水。
- Chantal：Mmm.
- Hugo：I’m prepared for that, aren’t you?(Q26)
  - 我准备好了，你呢?
- Chantal：Actually, I’m not going to accept that view.
  - 实际上，我不会接受这种观点。
- Hugo：Really? But she knows it’s the case – and everyone else says the same.
  - 真的吗？但她知道情况确实如此，其他人也这么说。
- Chantal：That doesn’t mean it has to be true for me.
  - 这并不意味着对我来说一定是真的。
- Hugo：OK. Well – I hope you’re right!
  - 好吧。我希望你是对的!
- Chantal：I thought the **speaker’s account of** her first job was fascinating.
  - 我认为演讲者对她第一份工作的描述很吸引人。
- Hugo：Yeah – she admitted she was lucky to get work being a personal dresser for a musician.
  - 是的，她承认自己很幸运能得到一份为音乐家做私人化妆师的工作。
  - She didn’t even apply for the job and there she was getting paid to choose all his clothes.
  - 她甚至都没有申请这份工作，她就在那里拿着钱为他挑选所有的衣服。
- Chantal：It must have felt amazing – though she said all she was looking for back then was experience, not financial reward.
  - 那感觉一定很棒——尽管她说她当时想要的只是经历，而不是金钱回报。
- Hugo：Mmm.
  - And then he was so mean, telling her she was more interested in her own appearance than his!(Q27)(q28)
  - 然后他又那么刻薄，告诉她她对自己的外表比对他的外表更感兴趣!
- Chantal：But – she did realise he was right about that(Q27)(Q28), which really made me think.
  - 但是，她确实意识到他是对的，这真的让我思考。
  - I’m always considering my own clothes but now I can see you should be focusing on your client!
  - 我一直在考虑我自己的衣服，但现在我知道你应该把注意力放在你的客户身上!
- Hugo：She obviously regretted losing the job.
  - 她显然后悔丢掉了工作。
- Chantal：Well, as she said, she should have hidden her negative feelings about him, but she didn’t(Q27)(Q28).
  - 嗯，就像她说的，她应该隐藏她对他的负面情绪，但她没有。

  - 她振作起来，接受了那份零售工作，这真的很勇敢。
  - Fancy working in a shop after that!
  - 真想不到之后还能在商店里工作!
- Chantal：Yeah – well, she recommended we all do it at some point.
  - 是啊——嗯，她建议我们在某个时候都这么做。
  - I guess as a designer you’d get to find out some useful information, like how big or small the average shopper is.
  - 我想作为一名设计师，你会发现一些有用的信息，比如购物者的平均身高。
- Hugo：I think that’s an issue for manufacturers, not designers.
  - 我认为这是制造商的问题，而不是设计师的问题。
  - However, it would be useful to know if there’s a gap in the market – you know, an item that no one’s stocking but that consumers are looking for.(Q29)(Q30)
  - 然而，知道市场上是否有缺口是有用的——你知道，一种没有人库存但消费者正在寻找的商品。
- Chantal：Yeah, people don’t give up searching.
  - 是的，人们不会放弃搜索。
  - They also take things back to the store if they aren’t right.
  - 他们还会把不对的东西退回商店。
- Hugo：Yeah.
  - Imagine you worked in an expensive shop and you found out the garments sold there were being returned because they … fell apart in the wash!(Q29)(Q30)
  - 想象一下，你在一家昂贵的商店工作，你发现那里出售的衣服被退回，因为它们在洗涤时坏了!

  - 是啊，知道这种事很好。
- Hugo：Yeah

## 剑 18 Test1 听力 Part4

For my presentation today I want to tell you about how groups of elephants have been moved and settled in new **reserves**.
在我今天的演讲中，我想告诉你们大象群是如何被转移到新的保护区定居的。

This is known as translocation and has been carried out in Malawi in Africa in recent years.
这被称为移地放归，这一行动已经在非洲的马拉维进行多年。

The reason this is being done is because of overpopulation of elephants in some areas.
这样做的原因是一些地区的大象数量过剩。

Overpopulation is a good problem to have and **not one we tend to hear about** very often.
种群过剩不是坏事，也不是我们经常听说的事。

In Malawi’s Majete National Park the elephant population had been **wiped out** by **poachers**, who killed the elephants for their ivory.
在马拉维的马杰特国家公园，大象数量被偷猎者消灭，偷猎者为了获取象牙而杀死大象。

But in 2003, the park was **restocked** and effective law enforcement was introduced.
但在 2003 年，公园重新放养大象并引入了有效的执法措施。

Since then, not a single elephant has been poached.
从那以后，再没有人偷猎大象。

In this safe environment, the elephant population boomed.
在这种安全的环境下，大象的数量激增。

Breeding went so well that there were more elephants than the park could support.
繁殖进行得非常顺利，以至于大象的数量超出了公园的承受能力。

This led to a number of problems.
这导致了许多问题。

Firstly, there was more competition for food, which meant that some elephants were suffering from hunger.
首先，对食物的竞争更加激烈，这意味着一些大象正在挨饿。

As there was a limit to the amount of food in the national park, some elephants began looking further **afield**.
由于国家公园的食物数量有限，一些大象开始寻找更远的地方来觅食。

Elephants were routinely knocking down **fences** around the park,(Q31) which then had to be repaired at a significant cost.
大象经常撞倒公园周围的围栏，然后不得不花费大量资金进行修复。

To solve this problem, the decision was made to move dozens of elephants from Majete National Park to Nkhotakota Wildlife Park, where there were no elephants.
为了解决这个问题，人们决定将几十头大象从马杰特国家公园转移到没有大象的恩霍塔科塔野生动物园。

But, obviously, attempting to move significant numbers of elephants to a new home 300 kilometres away is quite a challenge.
但是，很明显，试图将大量大象转移到 300 公里外的新家是一个相当大的挑战。

So how did this translocation process work in practice?
那么移地放归在实践中是如何运作的呢？

Elephants were moved in groups of between eight and twenty, all belonging to one family.(Q32)
大象以 8 到 20 头为一组，都属于一个家族。

Because relationships are very important to elephants, they all had to be moved at the same time.
因为家庭关系对大象来说非常重要，所以它们必须同时被转移。

A team of vets and **park rangers** flew over the park in helicopters and targeted a group, which were **rounded up** and directed to a **designated open plain**.(Q33)
一队兽医和公园护林员乘坐直升机飞越公园，找寻一个象群，这些大象被围起来并带到指定的开阔平原。

The vets then used **darts** to **immobilise** the elephants – this was a tricky **manoeuvre**, as they not only had to select the right dose of **tranquiliser** for different-sized elephants but they had to dart the elephants as they were running around.
然后兽医们用飞镖把大象固定住——这是一个棘手的操作，因为他们不仅要为不同大小的大象选择合适的镇定剂剂量，而且还要在大象跑来跑去的时候用飞镖把它们固定住。

This also had to be done as quickly as possible so as to minimise the stress caused.(Q34)
同时，这一动作必须尽快完成来尽量减少对动物造成的压力。

As soon as the elephants began to **flop** onto the ground, the team moved in to take care of them.
只要大象一扑倒在地上，工作人员就立即靠近去照顾它们。

To avoid the risk of **suffocation**, the team had to make sure none of the elephants were lying on their chests because their lungs could be crushed in this position.(Q35)
为了避免窒息的危险，摄制组必须确保没有大象是平躺着的，因为这种姿势可能会压碎它们的肺。

So all the elephants had to be placed on their sides.(Q35)
所以所有的大象都必须侧卧。

One person stayed with each elephant while they waited for the vets to do checks.
在他们等待兽医检查的时候，每头大象都有一个人陪着。

It was very important to keep an eye on their breathing – if there were fewer than six breaths per minute, the elephant would need urgent medical attention.(Q36)
密切关注它们的呼吸非常重要。如果每分钟呼吸次数少于六次，大象就需要紧急医疗护理。

**Collars** were fitted to the **matriarch** in each group so their movements could be tracked in their new home.
每组大象中的雌性族长都戴上了项圈，这样大象在新家里的一举一动都可以被追踪。

Measurements were taken of each elephant’s **tusks** – elephants with large tusks would be at greater risk from poachers – and also of their feet.(Q37)
工作人员对每头大象的象牙进行了测量。象牙大的大象更容易受到偷猎者的伤害。它们的脚也会被测量。

The elephants were then taken to a recovery area before being loaded onto trucks and transported to their new home.
这些大象随后被带到一个恢复区，然后被装上卡车运到它们的新家。

The elephants translocated to Nkhotakota settled in very well and the project has generally been accepted to have been a huge success – and not just for the elephants.
迁移到恩科塔科塔的大象安顿得很好。人们普遍认为该项目取得了巨大的成功，这不仅仅是对大象而言。

Employment prospects have improved enormously, contributing to rising living standards for the whole community.(Q38)
就业前景大大改善，有助于提高整个社会的生活水平。

Poaching is no longer an issue, as former poachers are able to find more reliable sources of income.
偷猎不再是一个问题，因为以前的偷猎者能够找到更可靠的收入来源。

In fact, many of them volunteered to give up their weapons, as they were no longer of any use to them.(Q39)
事实上，他们中的许多人自愿放弃他们的武器，因为它们对他们不再有任何用处。

More than two dozen elephants have been born at Nkhotakota since relocation.
自移地放归以来，已有二十多只大象在恩科塔科塔出生。

With an area of more than 1,800 square kilometres, there’s plenty of space for the elephant population to continue to grow.
面积超过 1800 平方公里，有足够的空间让大象数量继续增长。

Their presence is also helping to rebalance Nkhotakota’s damaged ecosystem and providing a **sustainable conservation model**, which could be **replicated** in other parks.
他们的存在也有助于让恩科塔科塔受损的生态系统回归平衡，并提供可持续的保护模式，其它公园也可以复制这模式。

All this has been **a big draw for** tourism, which contributes five times more than the illegal wildlife trade to GDP, and this is mainly because of the elephants.(Q40)
所有这些都对旅游业产生巨大吸引力。旅游业对 GDP 的贡献是非法野生动物贸易的五倍，而这一增加主要是因为大象。

There’s also been a dramatic rise in interest …
人们越来越有兴趣知道......
