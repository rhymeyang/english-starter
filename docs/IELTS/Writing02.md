## TASK 1

1. Who are you writing to?

Your next-door neighbour likes to listen to music late at night. Because of the loud music, you often lose sleep. Write a letter to the building manager. In your letter

Write at least 150 words.
You do NOT need to write any addresses.

Begin your letter as follows:

Dear ...

### Formal Letter: Opening

---

not good, it's unformal

Dear Mr Jackson,
How's it going? I just thought I'd write a few words about that young guy who moved in next door to me a few weeks back. Well, he plays this horrible rock music until 2 or 3 am and I can't stand that.

---

better, it's formal

Dear Mr Jackson,
I hope you are well. As the owner of flat 24, I am writing to you to complain about the behaviour of the tenant at flat 25, my immediate next-door neighbour. Since he moved in last month, my nights have been disturbed by the incessant loud music coming from his flat from around 10 pm until the early hours of the following morning.

### Formal Letter: Problem

---

better verion

The noise has affected us all very badly, especially our two young **school-age children**, as it is almost impossible for any of us to sleep either sufficiently or peacefully.

---

informal

None of us can get to sleep and that's really bad for our **young kids** who have school in the morning and for us too because we go to work.

### Formal Letter: Solution

---

not good

You must write a letter now telling this man to stop making this noise and if he doesn't do anything, then you really should call the police.

---

better

Might I suggest that a letter be sent to this tenant and to the owner of the flat, reminding them of the rules regarding noise as agreed at the general meeting of proprietors and tenants held last year?

### Formal Letter: Sign-Off

---

better one

I look forward to your comments on this matter.

Yours sincerely,
Alex

---

not good

Please, do something about this.

All the best,
Alex

### Letter 2

Dear Maria,

(give details about the concert)

What are you doing Saturday next week? I'll tell you what you're doing. You're coming with me to see Taylor Swift in London! I know that we don't get to see each other as much as we'd like, what is not surprising with work and family, but wouldn't it be great to get away from all that for a day? The show starts at 8 pm, but we can get there early, have lunch and do some sightseeing.

(describe how you won the tickets)
Now, believe it or not, I won the two tickets at work. It was our company's tenth anniversary party, and we all took part in this raffle. You can imagine how I felt when the boss read out my name as the winner of the concert tickets. I think it's the first time in my life I've ever won anything.

(explain why you've chosen your friend to go with you)
The moment I held the tickets in my hand, I thought of you. Remember when we were at school and we listened to her all the time? We knew the lyrics to all her songs. It's going to be so great to see her live. I can't wait.

See you soon,

Helen
