**Dear [Friend's Name],**

I hope you're doing well! Thank you so much for agreeing to stay at my place while I’m away. It gives me peace of mind knowing someone I trust is looking after things.

I've hidden the spare key under the small potted plant by the front door. It’s the one with the red flowers, so it should be easy to find. Just lift the pot, and you’ll see the key taped underneath.

While I'm gone, I’d really appreciate it if you could water the plants once every three days. The indoor plants need a little less water, so just a light sprinkle will do. Also, if you could check the mailbox and bring any packages inside, that would be great!

I’ll be back on the 15th of next month, so it's about two weeks from now. I’ll make sure to bring back some souvenirs for you as a thank-you. If you have any questions or need help with anything, feel free to reach out anytime.

Thanks again for helping out!

Best,
[Your Name]
